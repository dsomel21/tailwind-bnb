## Dive Into Tailwind

This repository serves as a means to play with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HOV95Szb84) where someone made an AirBnB clone and decided to do the same.

### Why Tailwind?

In the autumn of 2020, I had the pleasure of speaking with the founder, Adam Wathan and engaging in a Reactiflix Q&A.  

However, I was still unclear about:

* What does this tool offer that I can't do myself?
* How does it differentiate among component building libraries?
* Will it eventually become another layer of abstraction that I will ultimately have to fight?

A year later, I wanted to try it out . I haven't had any REAL issues with CSS modules, but it does require patience. I wanted something robust, small (in packaging), but that still gave me the freedom I wanted to build and style my UIs.
